## Welcome to Carolina AR/VR 🥽

**C**arolina **AR**/**VR** _(aka **CARVR**)_ is UNC-Chapel Hill’s extended reality student organization, promoting student exploration and development of XR technologies.

### What exactly is **E**xtended **R**eality?
**E**xtended **R**eality (**XR**) is an umbrella term encapsulating any technology that provides immersive experiences through any sensory domain. XR technology is constantly expanding, and immersion can be achieved through a variety of interfaces (e.g. head-mounted displays, olfactory displays, haptic gloves).
We can further distinguish the type of XR experience with the following terms: 
* **A**ugmented **R**eality (**AR**) – Augment what’s already there
* **M**ixed **R**eality (**MR**) – Interact with the real space + virtual content
* **V**irtual **R**eality (**VR**) – Total immersion in a virtual space

While the terms '**AR**', '**MR**', '**VR**' can be useful to categorize XR experiences, many see categorization as a subjective spectrum – increasing in complexity as new experiences are created. 

In addition to _seeing_ an XR experience (e.g. by wearing a head-mounted display), we can create immersion through any **sensory domain**. Each sensory domain can be thought of as a direct correlation to one's **sense organs**, as described below:
* **Visual** domain – See XR with your **eyes** 👀
  * Interface example: [Quest 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exu7r2vZpcw) **Head-Mounted Display (HMD)**
* **Aural** domain – Hear XR with your **ears (cochlea)** 👂👂
  * Interface example: [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql6mhhHCldY) **earbuds**
* **Haptic** domain – Feel XR with your **somatic system (skin, muscles, tendons, joints)** 🖐️🦶
  * Interface example: [LucidVR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yF-SJcg3zQ) **haptic gloves**
* **Olfactory** domain – Smell XR with your **nose** 👃
  * Interface example: [LIRIS XR Nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ECNCCKz8I) **olfactory atomizer display**
* **Gustatory** domain – Taste XR with your **tongue** 👅
  * Interface example: [Miyashita Lab Electric Salt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR62l67FEbo) **electric taste interface**

**Multisensory XR**
* Often, we can increase immersion when developing XR experiences by incorporating interfaces for __multiple__ sensory domains. Some people refer to this as multisensory XR, but there are many subjective ways to identify XR experiences that use more than one interaction method (e.g. multimodal XR). New terms gain traction as XR research evolves (e.g. **BCIs** and **vestibular** interfaces).

## Get involved with Carolina AR/VR
As an XR student organization, we host events and provide opportunities for our members to **explore**, **learn**, and **develop** within the XR space. Most notably, we do the following in these general areas:
* **Explore** via social events where you can try out various XR hardware while meeting other passionate individuals.
* **Learn** via workshops, panels, research showcases, and other exciting events.
* **Develop** via our development team on project(s) of interest.

To get involved, please [visit our website](https://uncarvr.org/) and [join the Carolina AR/VR Discord server](https://discord.gg/CgBeb7YUpX)!

### Our Development Team
* 🌐 Web
  * Creating web-based XR experiences (e.g. immersive websites with A-Frame)
* ⿻ Design
  * Designing XR experiences across all sensoring domains (e.g. 3D UI, modeling, animation, spatial sound production, haptic feedback design)
* 📱 Software
  * Integrating designs and hardware to develop full-fledged XR experiences (e.g. Unity development for Meta Quest, HoloLens, Magic Leap, Vision Pro)
* 🕹️ Hardware
  * Building XR interfaces to improve immersion (e.g. olfactory displays, haptic gloves, AR HMDs)

If you're interested in working on a project and/or checking-out equipment, please let us know in the **# 🥽｜projects** channel within our Discord server 🩵
